### I’m Jamie Curle.

I design, develop and deploy code, and I can lead, engage and develop people. I also have a knack for finding problems and then solving them (_in that order, which is important_). I may over-engineer on the first pass. Simply put, I'm a very useful generalist who makes life better for everyone and everything I'm around. 

I’ve been designing, developing, and deploying web applications (_and all sorts of web “stuff”_) since the late 1990s. I worked in various individual contributor (IC) roles (_design/development_) until 2016, when I started transitioning into engineering management (EM) roles (_senior, lead, head and eventually CTO & CIO_). I can do both roles well (_or so people tell me_) and although they're different in a fundamental way, I experience joy doing both and I'm very competant in either.

In 2022 I left my full time CTO/CIO to start a new venture - Trees & Code. I split my time between techworld (_software engineering, data privacy engineering and infosec / privacy consulting_) and treeworld (_arboriculture and woodland management_). In short I'd had a twenty year stretch at a desk with silicon and I wanted to touch the grass. I still do the odd bit of tree work (_I'm a qualified arborist_) and spend any spare time I have left in my workshop or my small parcel of semi-ancient woodland. If you ask really nicely, I may come and take care of your trees for a modest fee.  

In late 2025 I decided to build a SaaS product - [Privacy Posture][4].  However, startups are hard and the odds are stacked against me, so whilst my linked screems "founder founder founder" that's just show boating. I'm open to work. I'm most likley interested in positions where I'm leading people and collaborating accross the organisation. In small startups that's called CTO, in larger orgs it's more likely a team lead or engineering manager. I'm not hung up on titles.

I am on a credential aquistion exercise and right now I'm studying to get my CIPP/E qualification. I'm into privacy and learned enough from the last few years consulting and my time at SoPost to see the disconnect in privacy tooling for developers and small businesses.

Lead Software Engineer specialising in Elixir, privacy engineering, and security-first systems. Part-time arborist and aspiring woodsman.

I build robust, privacy-respecting systems and lead engineering teams that ship with confidence. 

I'm open to lead engineering roles where I can combine technical depth with people leadership in Elixir-focused teams, privacy engineering, or infosec domains. I've been working alone for a year and I miss the interactions, the mess, the wins and above all else - leading.

My background spans the full stack of technical leadership: from first technical hire through CTO/CIO at a scale-up, then intentionally stepping back into hands-on engineering because that's where I do my best work. I've designed and deployed systems from bare metal to cloud, implemented ISO 27001 and GDPR compliance from the ground up, and built high-performing engineering teams that balance velocity with quality.

I specialise in Elixir/OTP systems normally based around Phoenix and LiveView (but not always), privacy-by-design architecture, and security posture. I'm actively incorporating and (increasingly moving to) with AI-driven development workflows, exploring how AI tooling can accelerate delivery whilst maintaining code quality, security standards, and team effectiveness. Whether it's leading technical delivery, mentoring engineers, or bridging the gap between compliance requirements and pragmatic implementation, I focus on shipping technology that actually works whilst helping people recognise their own capabilities.

Currently pursuing CIPP/E certification to formalise my privacy engineering expertise, with CISSP to follow.

I thrive in small, high-trust environments where engineering standards are non-negotiable and competence speaks for itself. Available for full-time lead roles or specialised consultancy through Trees & Code.

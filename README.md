### I’m Jamie Curle.

I design, develop and deploy code, and I can lead, engage and develop people. I also have a knack for finding problems and then solving them (_in that order, which is important_). I may over-engineer on the first pass. Simply put, I'm a very useful generalist who makes life better for everyone and everything I'm around. 

I’ve been designing, developing, and deploying web applications (_and all sorts of web “stuff”_) since the late 1990s. I worked in various individual contributor (IC) roles (_design/development_) until 2016, when I started transitioning into engineering management (EM) roles (_senior, lead, head and eventually CTO & CIO_). I can do both roles well (_or so people tell me_) and although they're different in a fundamental way, I experience joy.

I was looking for a job from March 2025 until September 2025 but now I’m not. Job hunting in 2025 is somewhere between “vile” and “absurd” and I’m pretty certain it was a poor investment of my limited time on this planet. For what it is worth, I find the practice of hiring based on a CV as a first step one of the most idiotic things that can be done when seeking talent. Speak to people as a first step. If you must filter because of thousands of applicants, then just ask some filtering questions. “You will be asked to give evidence of X, can you confirm you can do that”. There’s too much noise and too little signal in the modern hiring process and most of that is people sending hundreds of CVs because employers are rejecting hundreds of CVs. No one is standing up and saying “hmm, let’s stop amplifying the noise and filter for signal". Except me, but I'm not really that bullish on doing an HR startup.

I also own a woodland, which I manage myself. I do the odd bit of tree work (_I'm a qualified arborist_) and spend any spare time I have left in my workshop. If you ask really nicely, I may come and take care of your trees for a modest fee.

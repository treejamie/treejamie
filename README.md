### I’m Jamie Curle.

I design, develop and deploy code, and I can lead, engage and develop people. I also have a knack for finding problems and then solving them (_in that order, which is important_). I may over-engineer on the first pass. Simply put, I'm a very useful generalist who makes life better for everyone and everything I'm around. 

I’ve been designing, developing, and deploying web applications (_and all sorts of web “stuff”_) since the late 1990s. I worked in various individual contributor (IC) roles (_design/development_) until 2016, when I started transitioning into engineering management (EM) roles (_senior, lead, head and eventually CTO & CIO_). I can do both roles well (_or so people tell me_) and although they're different in a fundamental way, I experience joy doing both.

In 2022 I took a few years away from techworld to go and study arboriculture and woodland management. I also own a woodland, which I manage myself using my newly learned skills. I do the odd bit of tree work (_I'm a qualified arborist_) and spend any spare time I have left in my workshop. If you ask really nicely, I may come and take care of your trees for a modest fee.  

In early 2025 I returned to the techword hoping to get job in IC/EM so I could spend my time between the woods and a desk job. However, somewhere between 2022 and 2025 hiring became silly and I found it really hard to get a job. "Thanks but no thanks, and no reasons" was the norm so in late 2025 I took that as a chance to become a founder of my thing - [Privacy Posture][4].
